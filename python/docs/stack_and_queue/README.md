# Stacks and Queues
- Create a Stack class that has a top property.
>It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
- It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
> This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue
