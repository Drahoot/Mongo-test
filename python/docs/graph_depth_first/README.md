# Depth First Traversal
Created a new function within the graph class

## Challenge
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time: O(n+e)
  - This is because it has to recurse through the entire graph once, and the `e` is for all the edges in the graph.
- Space: O(n)
  - This is because it creates and returns a list of all the vertices in the graph and would this be O(n)
