# Graphs
Nodes ,edges, can added, weight between neighbors can be read, only a graph with a node and edge can be returned otherwise it will return null

## Challenge
Create a graph datastructure

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O: Time/Space O(1) as graph will only change with single additions. Time is o(1) as it is dependant on size of graph
